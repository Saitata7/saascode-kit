# SaasCode Kit — Universal Test Scorecard

> Tests saascode-kit commands against 16 real-world projects covering every major stack.
> Goal: verify proper output, error messages, and graceful degradation for all project types.

---

## Testing Rules

### Rule 1: Don't Waste Tokens — One Proof Is Enough

If a command works (finds at least 1 error/warning/issue that satisfies its purpose), that proves the detection works. **Do NOT re-verify all findings.** Move on.

| Command | "It works" proof | Stop when |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| `init` | Exit 0, `.saascode/` created | Confirmed once |
| `claude` | CLAUDE.md exists with content | Confirmed once |
| `review` | Finds ≥1 finding (any severity) | First finding proves detection works |
| `parity` | Produces output (match or mismatch) | Any output = working |
| `check-file` | Returns result for the file | Any result = working |
| `audit` | Produces ≥1 line of audit output | Any output = working |
| `predeploy` | Runs gates, shows pass/skip/fail | Any gate output = working |
| `sweep` | Produces summary | Any summary = working |
| `report` | Shows issues or "no issues" | Any output = working |

For graceful skips (unsupported languages), verify the skip message appears once. Done.

### Rule 2: Fix-Confirm-Revert Cycle

```
For each project:
  1. COPY to temp dir (originals stay pristine)
  2. Add saascode-kit.yaml manifest
  3. Run all 9 commands
  4. If kit bug found:
     a. Fix bug in saascode-kit source
     b. Re-test SAME project in fresh temp copy
     c. Confirm fix works
  5. Record PASS/SKIP/FAIL in score sheet
  6. DELETE temp copy
  7. Move to next project
```

**Why keep originals pristine:**
- Can re-test with different saascode-kit versions
- Can re-test with Cursor, Windsurf, or other tools
- Can run the full suite again after bulk fixes
- No "works on my machine" — always starts from clean clone

### Rule 3: Test Order — Smart Sequencing

Test projects in this order to maximize early bug discovery:

| Phase | Projects | Why first |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | `01-ts-nestjs-nextjs` | Deepest coverage — TS monorepo exercises ALL commands fully. Most likely to find kit bugs. |
| **Phase 2** | `03-py-django`, `04-java-spring` | New AST reviewers — untested code, highest bug probability. |
| **Phase 3** | `05-go-api`, `02-js-express`, `10-php-laravel` | Graceful skip testing — verify "not available" messages. |
| **Phase 4** | `06-chrome`, `07-vscode`, `08-react-native`, `09-react-spa` | Extension/mobile/SPA variants — less likely to have new bugs if Phase 1 TS passed. |
| **Phase 5** | `11-rust`, `12-c`, `13-html`, `14-jupyter`, `15-rails`, `16-kotlin` | Out-of-scope projects — pure negative testing. Should all gracefully skip. |

**Rationale:** Fix all bugs in Phase 1-2, so Phase 3-5 are mostly just confirmation runs.

### Rule 4: Fail Fast, Batch Fix

- If a command fails on Project 01, **don't test it on Project 02-16 yet**
- Fix the bug first, re-confirm on 01, then continue
- This prevents 16 identical failures for the same bug

### Rule 5: What Counts as a Bug vs Expected Behavior

| Situation | Bug or Expected? | Action |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Command crashes with stack trace | **BUG** | Fix immediately |
| Command exits non-zero unexpectedly | **BUG** | Fix immediately |
| Command produces no output at all | **BUG** | Fix immediately |
| Command shows wrong language detection | **BUG** | Fix in ast-review.sh dispatcher |
| "AST review not available for Go" | **EXPECTED** | Score as SKIP (1 point) |
| "SKIP: npm not found" during audit | **EXPECTED** | Score as SKIP (1 point) |
| Review finds 0 issues on clean code | **EXPECTED** | Score as PASS (2 points) |
| Predeploy skips build (no build tool) | **EXPECTED** | Score as SKIP (1 point) |

---

### `saascode sweep`

| # | Project | Expected Behavior | Expected Exit | Pass Criteria |
|---|---------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| All | All 16 | Runs all checks (audit + predeploy + review) | 0 | Produces summary, no crash |

## Error Message Verification Checklist

These are the specific error messages we need to verify are correct:

### AST Review — Language Skip Messages

- [ ] **Go project** → `"AST review is not available for Go."` + suggests `go vet`
- [ ] **JS project** → `"AST review is not available for JavaScript."` + suggests `check-file`/`audit`
- [ ] **PHP project** → `"AST review is not available for language: php"` + suggests `audit`
- [ ] **Rust project** → `"AST review is not available for language: rust"` + suggests `audit`
- [ ] **Ruby project** → `"AST review is not available for language: ruby"` + suggests `audit`
- [ ] **Kotlin project** → `"AST review is not available for language: kotlin"` + suggests `audit`
- [ ] **C project** → `"AST review is not available for language: ..."` + suggests `audit`
- [ ] **Static HTML** → Graceful skip or TS fallback (no crash)

### AST Review — Correct Dispatcher Routing

- [ ] **TypeScript** project → routes to `ast-review.ts` (ts-morph)
- [ ] **Python** project → routes to `ast-review-python.py` (stdlib ast)
- [ ] **Java** project → routes to `ast-review-java.sh` (grep/awk)

### Parity — Missing Frontend/Backend Messages

- [ ] Backend-only projects → does not crash, shows "no frontend found" or similar
- [ ] Frontend-only projects → does not crash, shows "no backend found" or similar
- [ ] Non-web projects (CLI, mobile) → does not crash

### Audit — Missing Tool Messages

- [ ] No `npm` → `"SKIP: npm not found"` or similar
- [ ] No `pip-audit` → `"SKIP: pip-audit not found"` or similar
- [ ] No `govulncheck` → `"SKIP: govulncheck not found"` or similar
- [ ] No `cargo audit` → `"SKIP: cargo not found"` or similar

### Check-File — File Extension Handling

- [ ] `.ts` file → runs TypeScript checks
- [ ] `.py` file → runs Python checks
- [ ] `.java` file → runs Java checks
- [ ] `.go` file → runs Go checks
- [ ] `.php` file → runs PHP checks
- [ ] `.rs` file → runs Rust checks
- [ ] `.rb` file → runs Ruby checks
- [ ] `.c` file → runs C checks (or generic)
- [ ] `.html` file → runs HTML checks (or generic)
- [ ] `.kt` file → runs Kotlin checks (or generic)

## Scoring

### Per-Project Score

Each project is scored on 9 commands. Each command gets:

| Result | Points | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| PASS | 2 | Command runs correctly, output matches expectations |
| SKIP | 1 | Command correctly identifies unsupported scenario, shows helpful message |
| FAIL | 0 | Command crashes, wrong exit code, missing/wrong error message |
| ERROR | 0 | Command throws unhandled exception or produces no output |

**Max score per project:** 18 points (9 commands x 2 points)
**Max total score:** 288 points (16 projects x 18 points)

### Scoring Thresholds

| Score Range | Grade | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 270-288 | A+ | Universal support confirmed |
| 252-269 | A | Excellent, minor gaps |
| 230-251 | B | Good, some unsupported paths need work |
| 200-229 | C | Acceptable, several commands fail on edge cases |
| < 200 | D | Needs significant work |

## Notes

- Original clones use `--depth 1` — minimal disk usage, always reusable
- Temp copies are created fresh per test run — no state leaks between projects
- Manifests are auto-generated based on detected project structure
- The `saascode-kit/` directory is **symlinked** into temp copies (not copied) so bug fixes take effect immediately on re-test
- Commands that invoke real tools (npm audit, mvn, etc.) may time out — timeout = SKIP, not FAIL
