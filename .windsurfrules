# Windsurf Rules for SaasCode Kit Development

## File Creation Rules

### ❌ DO NOT CREATE:
- Extra documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- Duplicate test result files
- Temporary analysis files (TEMP-*, ANALYSIS-*, DEBUG-*)
- Log files in project root
- Any files starting with TEMP_, TEST_, ANALYSIS_, DEBUG_

### ✅ ONLY CREATE:
- Files explicitly requested by user
- Required config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Source code files in appropriate directories
- Test files in tests/ directory (if adding new tests)

### Before Creating ANY File:
1. **Ask first** - "Should I create [filename]?"
2. **Check if it already exists**
3. **Verify it's in the right directory**
4. **Confirm it's not duplicate functionality**

## Directory Structure (NEVER modify without permission)

```
saascode-kit/
├── scripts/          # Core scripts only (.sh, .ts, .py, .js)
├── templates/        # Template files only
├── hooks/            # Git hooks only
├── tests/            # Test infrastructure only
│   ├── run-tests.sh
│   ├── TEST-RESULTS.md
│   ├── TEST-SCORECARD.md
│   └── README.md
└── docs/            # Documentation only
```

## Testing Rules

### When Running Tests:
- Use `tests/run-tests.sh` (don't create new runners)
- Write results to `tests/results.txt` ONLY (temp file, gitignored)
- Don't create separate result files per test
- Don't create analysis files unless requested

### Test Results Documentation:
- Update existing `tests/TEST-RESULTS.md`
- DON'T create: TEST-WINDSURF-RESULTS.md, TEST-ANALYSIS.md, etc.
- ONE results file, updated with latest test run

## Commands to Run

### Before Every Commit:
```bash
saascode review              # Code review
saascode parity              # Check frontend-backend consistency
bash scripts/validate-structure.sh  # Validate no unwanted files
```

### After Major Changes:
```bash
saascode sweep              # Full audit + predeploy + review
saascode report             # View logged issues
```

## General Guidelines

### Stay Organized:
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Don't duplicate functionality
- Clean up after yourself (remove temp files)
- Use .gitignore for temp/generated files

### Avoid Hallucinations:
- Only reference files that actually exist
- Verify paths before using them
- Don't assume features exist - check first
- Read existing code before suggesting changes

### Communication:
- Ask clarifying questions instead of guessing
- Propose changes before making them
- Explain reasoning for file creation
- Confirm destructive actions

## Summary

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, ask the user. Creating unwanted files is worse than asking too many questions.

**Validation:** Run `bash scripts/validate-structure.sh` before committing to catch issues early.
